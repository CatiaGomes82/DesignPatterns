## Observer
The Observer is a design pattern where an Observavble stores a list of subscribed events and automatically notifies when an event happens.

>An observable object usually contains 3 important parts:
>
>- observers: an array of observers that will get notified whenever a specific event occurs
> - subscribe(): a method in order to add observers to the observers list
>- unsubscribe(): a method in order to remove observers from the observers list
>- notify(): a method to notify all observers whenever a specific event occurs

### Pros
> Using the observer pattern is a great way to enforce separation of concerns and the single-responsiblity principle. The observer objects arenâ€™t tightly coupled to the observable object, and can be (de)coupled at any time. The observable object is responsible for monitoring the events, while the observers simply handle the received data.

### Cons
> If an observer becomes too complex, it may cause performance issues when notifying all subscribers.
